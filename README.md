# Mapping_Earthquakes

This project involved using the Leaflet library in JS and use the Mapbox api to display maps and earthquake related data which was accessed form the US gov site to display the info related to earthquakes in different map layers.

## Results

### Deliverable 1: To gather data on Tectonic Plates and display the layer

The screenshot shows the tectonic plates added as a layer on the map. I was unable to directly read the online link due to the CORS error but I downloaded the data and pointed to the data folder since I am not spinning up a server to host this page. 

### Deliverable 2: To gather data on major earthquakes and display the layer

The screenshot shows the tectonic plates added as a layer on the map as well as the major earthquakes data pulled from the US site.

### Deliverable 3: To add a third tiled layer to the map and toggle between the different styles

The screenshot shows the different tiled styles for the map along with the tectonic plates added as a layer on the map as well as the major earthquakes data pulled from the US site.
